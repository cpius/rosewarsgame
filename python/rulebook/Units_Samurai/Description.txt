Here, the Samurai can attack the Pikeman. If the Pikeman is killed in the first attack, it can advance to that tile. Then it can attack the Catapult in the same action, but even if it wins this attack, it cannot move to that tile. If it doesnt succeed in the first attack against Pikeman, it can attack it again a second time, and advance to that tile if it wins. If this happens, it cannot attack the catapult afterwards. It cannot attack the Knight in this turn.
