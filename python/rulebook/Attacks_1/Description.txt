3. Battle.

There are two types of attacks, ranged and melee.

A melee unit can attack units standing on tiles they can move to. It first moves to a tile adjacent to the target tile, and then attacks. If it wins the attack, the player can choose to move the unit to the conquered tile, or choose to stay.

Here, the Knight can attack the Catapult from either of the marked tiles.
