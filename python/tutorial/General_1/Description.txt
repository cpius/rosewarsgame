This is the beginning of a game. You are on the bottom half of the board, and your opponent is on the top half. Your goal is to fight and/or maneuver your way past his units to his back line. If you reach the back line with one of your units, you immediately win the game.

Each turn you have two actions. You can use each of those to move one unit, or to attack with one unit.
